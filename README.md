# Queue-Priority-Queue

Explore Java's built-in **PriorityQueue** class.

Create a **Task** list for tasks with various priorities and add them to a PriorityQueue and iterate through them and display them to the screen in order from highest priority to lowest priority.

Also switch how the priority works:

* Initially low numbers = high priority.

* However, I show a simple way to reverse this and make high numbers = high priority.


## TODO: for students:

* Add more Tasks, jumble up the order in which they are added, and confirm for yourself that the items are always retrieved in priority order.

* Explore alternate ways to iterate through / access the PriorityQueue, such as:
```
   while (!pq.isEmpty())
      System.out.println(pq.remove());
```

* Now you do it: create a **Patient** class and add Patient objects to a PriorityQueue and simulate a hospital waiting room.
